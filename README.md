# 👨‍🏫 Teacher’s Day Challenge - 2025

Welcome to my coding journey as part of the **#TeachersDayChallenge** under the **Mission #DrGViswanathan initiative** by VIT Bhopal.  
This initiative encourages students to practice daily coding, share progress, and grow step-by-step with gratitude towards our mentors. 🌟

## 📅 Daily Coding Log

This repository will be updated **daily** with coding problems and solutions that help build core programming skills such as:
- Array and string manipulation
- Linked list operations
- Hashing and searching techniques
- Recursion, dynamic programming, and more

📂 Each day will have its own folder (`day-1/`, `day-2/`, ...) with clearly written and compiled C++ solutions.
